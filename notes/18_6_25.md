### Repository, Commit, Branch, Remote
Repositories describe the entire project with all files and git information.  
Commits are packages of changes uploaded to the Repository. They can be pushed into the selected Branch to integrate the changes into it.  
Branches are different versions of the project that can exist in parallel. They may have their own different versions of the same file and have different commit histories.  
Remote descripes the copy of the repository located on an external host like github. Individual machines can interface with them to pull or push changes.
