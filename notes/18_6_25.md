### Repository, Commit, Branch, Remote
**Repositories** describe the entire project with all files and git information.  

**Commits** are packages of changes uploaded to the Repository. They can be pushed into the selected Branch to integrate the changes into it.  

**Branches** are different versions of the project that can exist in parallel. They may have their own different versions of the same file and have different commit histories.  

**Remote** descripes the copy of the repository located on an external host like github. Individual machines can interface with them to pull or push changes.

### Git commands
**Staging** refers to the process of preparing the changes to be committed. Authors may decide to commit only some of the files they have edited, so they **stage** these. Only staged files will be commited.  

**Commiting** uploads staged files to the remote server as a "package" called a Commit.  

**Fetching** retrieves the current version of the selected branch of a repository from the remote server. It does not overwrite the local version of the branch. This allows the remote version to be compared to the local one.  

**Pulling** integrates remote changes to the local branch, thereby overwriting existing files.  

**Merging** combines the changes from two different branches.
