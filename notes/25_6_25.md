        Declaring a variable is like "creating" the variable  
        Defining a variable means assigning any value to a previously created(declared) one
    4. In JavaScript, values like 0.1 are represented as a floating point number that is as close as possilbe to 0.1, like 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.  
    this introduces errors when doing calculations with these kinds of numbers.
